Hi,

Some more important things to know about the framework:

Assignment 1.5: You should definitely not use the map data structure of the framework. Use the lookup table (lut) as explained in the tutorial today.

The following pdf contains some framework documentation: framework_description.pdf

If you framework does not compile correctly you are probably missing one of these packages:

indent

xsltproc

flex (some distro's also require "flex-devel")

bison

graphviz

The TAs
