Hi,

A short summary of the important files and steps to add a traversal and phase to the compiler:

1. global/ast.xml:
Add traversal to <phases> <general>

2. global/phase.mac:
Add a phase and subphase that runs the traversal.
If you want to run a traversal multiple times you just add multiple subphases of it.

3. Traversal code:
- Location: src/my_traversal
- header file declares traversal function for every node that is traversed manually.
  Declare the 'driver' function, normally called:

   traversal_prefix + "do" + traversal_name  (eg. COPdoCountOperators)
- c-file: implementation of these functions and info structure support code:

  struct definition + accessors + constructor + destructor

4. Makefile.Targets:
Add my_traversal directory to src variable and list the object files to
compile.
